Data types are used everywhere in a programming language like C#. 
Because it's a strongly typed language, you are required to inform the compiler about which data types you wish to use every time you declare a variable, as you will see in the chapter about variables. 
In this chapter we will take a look at some of the most used data types and how they work. 

*bool is one of the simplest data types. It can contain only 2 values - false or true. 
The bool type is important to understand when using logical operators like the if statement. 

*int is short for integer, a data type for storing numbers without decimals. 
When working with numbers, int is the most commonly used data type. 
Integers have several data types within C#, depending on the size of the number they are supposed to store. 

*string is used for storing text, that is, a number of chars. In C#, strings are immutable, which means that strings are never changed after they have been created. 
When using methods which changes a string, the actual string is not changed - a new string is returned instead.
 
*char is used for storing a single character. 

*float is one of the data types used to store numbers which may or may not contain decimals.
