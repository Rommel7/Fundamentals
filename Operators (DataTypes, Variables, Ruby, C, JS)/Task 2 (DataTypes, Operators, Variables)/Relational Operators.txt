5) Şərt operatorları hansılardır?


Consider a situation where we create two variables and assign them some values as follows −

		A = 20
		B = 10
Here, it is obvious that variable A is greater than B in values. 
So, we need the help of some symbols to write such expressions which are called relational expressions. 
If we use C programming language, then it will be written as follows −

		(A > B)
Here, we used a symbol > and it is called a relational operator and in their simplest form, they produce Boolean results which means the result will be either true or false. 
Similarly, a programming language provides various relational operators. 
The following table lists down a few of the important relational operators available in C programming language. 
Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then −

	Operator					Description																Example
	==		Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.							(A == B) is not true.
	!=		Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.			(A != B) is true.
	>		Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.		(A > B) is not true.
	<		Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.		(A < B) is true.
	>=		Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A >= B) is not true.
	<=		Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A <= B) is true.
	
Here, we will show you one example of C Programming which makes use of if conditional statement. 
Though this statement will be discussed later in a separate chapter, but in short, we use if statement to check a condition and if the condition is true, then the body of if statement is executed, otherwise the body of if statement is skipped.

#include <stdio.h>

main() {

   int a, b;
   
   a = 10;
   b = 20;
   
   /* Here we check whether a is equal to 10 or not */
   if( a == 10 ) {
	
      /* if a is equal to 10 then this body will be executed */
      printf( "a is equal to 10\n");
   }
   
   /* Here we check whether b is equal to 10 or not */
   if( b == 10 ) {
	
      /* if b is equal to 10 then this body will be executed */
      printf( "b is equal to 10\n");
   }
   
   /* Here we check if a is less b than or not */
   if( a < b ) {
	
      /* if a is less than b then this body will be executed */
      printf( "a is less than b\n");
   }
   
   /* Here we check whether a and b are not equal */
   if( a != b ) {
	
      /* if a is not equal to b then this body will be executed */
      printf( "a is not equal to b\n");
   }
}
